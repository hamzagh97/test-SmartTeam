###Technical Test smart team README
##Introduction
This repository contains the solution for the technical test assigned to me. The test involves developing an application that manages employee vacation requests. The application allows employees to submit vacation requests, and administrators can review and approve or reject them.

#Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
frontend: Contains the source code of the client side application.
backend: Contains the source code of the server side application.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

#Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/hamzagh97/test-SmartTeam.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd test-SmartTeam cd directory

#Install dependencies:
npm install

#Running the Application
To run the application locally, use the following command:
go to frontend directory
npm run dev
This will start the nextjs development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

go to backend directory
npm run dev
This will start the nodejs development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:5000.

#Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables to be set:
for frontend:
baseURL: The base URL of the API server.
for backend:
PORT: Specifies the port number on which the application server listens for incoming HTTP requests
db: Specifies the connection URI for the application's database. It typically includes details such as the host, port, authentication credentials, and database name
